                  <ImPointRight /> I find a great deal of pleasure in being an inspiration, source of energy, and motivation to those around me. I enjoy anything competitive, as well as some relaxing walks/runs while listening to podcasts or books. I am avid about sports and run a soccer league. I love freediving, golf, tennis, rock climbing, boats, cars. I love to teach. For the last 5 years, I have spent about 3 hours a week teaching software and soft skills 1 on 1 with several mentees. As a very curious person, lately, I have been enthralled with Data Science.

                  <ImPointRight /> As soon as Iâ€™m awake roughly 5:00 am EST, with coffee and bagel in hand, I am already reading Hacker News, and getting updates on the latest and greatest in Tech. One of my favorite books is The 5 AM Club (5AC!). I have a daily routine of compulsively scouring through the kaleidoscope of docs, Github issues, and online community backlogs (Discord, HackerNews, RSS feeds, Quora, StackOverflow, devdocs.io). From home, I often experiment with cutting-edge and bleeding-edge technologies. I believe that understanding the difference between the two is a critical distinction to make.
